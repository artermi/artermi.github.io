# Notes of some Topics.

My notes was written in Overleaf, Hackmd, and hand-written. 

In the first hand, I wanted to type everything in Hackmd, since markdown is easy and beautify. However, I later found out markdown compiles very slow if it contains a lot of mathematic notations.

I now type everything in pdf file (with Overleaf or my iPad Handwriting).
