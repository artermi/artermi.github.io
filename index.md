# Welcome to my page! 歡迎參觀!

My name is Colin Cleveland. I am a PhD Candidate in King's Colege London (KCL) Informatic department.  I am working on **Algorithmic Game Theory** research (more precisely, Voting Theory) under Dr Bart de Keijzer and Dr Maria Polukarov's supervision. I also research in **Evolutionary Game Theory** with Dr Hsuan-Wei Lee in Lehigh University (USA).

Besides of my research, I also teach as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for courses including Elementary Logic, Fundamentals of Computation, and Software Engineering..
